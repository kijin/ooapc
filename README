OOAPC: An object-oriented interface to APC
==========================================

This class exposes an object-oriented interface to APC functions.
The interface can also serve as a drop-in replacement for the Memcache class,
except connection-related methods which is unnecessary in the case of APC.

Code Example:
    
    $apc = new OOAPC;
    $apc->set($key, $value, $ttl);  // $value will be automatically serialized.
    echo $apc->get($key);

Methods Reference:
    
    is_enabled()
        Returns true if APC is enabled, and false otherwise.
    
    get($key)
        Returns the cached value, or false if the key is not found.
        
    set($key, $value, [$ttl = 0], [$ttl = 0])
        Stores the value under the key, whether or not the key exists.
        Returns true on success and false on failure.
        
    add($key, $value, [$ttl = 0], [$ttl = 0])
        Stores the value under the key, only if the key does not already exist.
        Returns true on success and false on failure.
        
    replace($key, $value, [$ttl = 0], [$ttl = 0])
        Stores the value under the key, only if the key already exists.
        Returns true on success and false on failure.
        
    delete($key)
        Deletes the key. Returns true on success and false on failure.
        
    increment($key, [$diff = 1])
        Increments an integer stored under the key.
        If the key is not found or the value is not an integer, this will fail.
        Returns the new value, or false on failure.
    
    decrement($key, [$diff = 1])
        Decrements an integer stored under the key.
        If the key is not found or the value is not an integer, this will fail.
        Returns the new value, or false on failure.
        
    flush()
        Deletes all keys from the APC user cache.
    
Known Issues:

    Depending on the APC version, set() and replace() may occasionally fail,
    especially when they are called repeatedly on the same key.
